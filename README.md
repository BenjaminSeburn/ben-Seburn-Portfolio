Ben Seburn's Portfolio

The Tempature converter was only shown by the instuctor to be run through the console. I took this lesson and wrote a page that would use user input to complete the conversion.

The following projects we taught and written along side the instructor
Todo Tracker
  This was made to create a list of user inputs and then clear them with the push of a button.

Matching Game
  This is a simple matching game where the user clicks on 2 of the cards and they flip revealing the underlying image. If they match they disappear and if they do not they re-flip.
